Playing the famous Chitlin' Circuit as well as performing around the world, Allen's music and enthusiasm has been shared with thousands of people. Music is in Allen's blood -- he got his start from his father and uncles who were known as the Allen Brothers Band. Allen carries on the family legacy wherever he goes. His music runs deep. "When I play," says Allen, "People who may have never heard of me leave the show with a feeling that we're old friends or family." From B.B. King to Otis Redding, Slam has a way of making you feel the Soul of the Music. It's often difficult to tell if he's doing one of his originals or an old blues or soul cover. Regardless, he makes all the music his own.</p>

Guy will be performing two sets on Saturday.  When Guy Davis plays the blues, he doesn’t want you to notice how much art is involved. “It takes work making a song that’s simple, and playful, and easy to do,” he says. “And I don’t want people to see that. I want to uplift and create something that causes delight. And I want some little eight-year-old kid in the front row to have big eyes and say, ‘Hey, I want to do that!’.”For more information about Guy Davis visit <a href="http://www.guydavis.com/" target="_blank">www.guydavis.com.</a></p>

 <p style="margin-bottom:20px !important; clear:both">In today's music scene there are hundreds of talented guitarists vying for the brass ring, and there are many, many great players out there. But there are very few with the heart and soul of Bobby Kyle. Blunt and to the point, Bobby's singular stylings resonate with maturity, talent and inspiration, bringing us a genesis of contemporary music that is characteristically all his own. Now performing with his own band, Bobby's emotional, soulful voice rings true, and is forged with a raw, distinctive quality all his own. Honest and forthright, Bobby's original songs tell the story of Everyman with a passion born of life, love and loss.</p>
