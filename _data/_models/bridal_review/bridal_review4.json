Kristen's crew was very friendly and accommodating going above and beyond their duties. The food is phenomenal... and the preferred vendors are seriously the best of the best! We had our ceremony indoors at the Lodge which really gave our wedding that cozy intimate feeling. We like that Split Rock had different ballrooms to accommodate any size wedding. We requested the Governor's Ballroom which can hold 100 people nicely. Great dance floor! This venue offers a great package deal, helping you to create an elegant wedding on a low budget!</p>\n<p><strong>-Amanda</strong></p>"}
