{"name":"item2","text":"<p class=\"wedding-reviews\">This was a great place to have our wedding. We had the ceremony there down at the lake side which was beautiful, everyone commented on it. When we started our Journey with split Rock we had one wedding specialist, then she left and we had another then she left and we had gotten another. The last wedding specialist that we had, had come just about three or four months before our wedding. At this time we were a little worried about things, because we had been through so many by this point. I'm still glad we went with Split Rock though because I can not say enough about our wedding specialist Gladys, she was so accommodating in every way! She was available for us at all times and she was the only one out of all of them that took her time with us and explained everything. I recommend this venue just because of her. We had met with different people and management in between all of our different wedding specials and I was not impressed with any of them, but Gladys did an amazing job over all, and also in a short period of time. I can't not Thank her enough and be more happier with their service she provided for us. She was also very nice and so down to earth.</p>\n<p><strong>-Nicole</strong></p>"}
