{"name":"item3","text":"<p class=\"wedding-reviews\">Split rock did a fabulous job on my wedding! Kristen won me over in the first meeting. She was so accommodating and prepared to work with what I wanted not try to fit me into their box of their typical wedding! And I feel I got a lot for the price! Chris(my maitre de) was incredibly attentive without being overbearing!! he kept things running smoothly and was always there to help when needed. Thanks for an awesome day Kristen and Chris!</p>\n<p><strong>-Private User</strong></p>"}
