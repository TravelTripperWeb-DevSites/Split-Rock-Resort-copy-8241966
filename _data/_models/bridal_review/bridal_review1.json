Our wedding specialist was Gladys and she went above and beyond! She was absolutely amazing!! Not only was she very attentive to our needs but she was also with our wedding party and guests! Gladys was great to communicate and work with. Our wedding ran smoothly because of her. She made sure we were taken care of until we were in our room for the night and even checked in with us the next morning. She really cared about our wedding and made it perfect!! We couldn't have asked for a better person!! The resort it self was wonderful as well! It was beautiful and all of the staff were very pleasant and helpful!! We are beyond happy and satisfied with our experience!!</p>\n<p><strong>-Heather</strong></p>"}
