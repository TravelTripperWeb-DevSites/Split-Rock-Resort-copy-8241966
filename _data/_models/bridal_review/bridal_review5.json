{"name":"item5","text":"<p class=\"wedding-reviews\">Kristen and crew were amazing. For the price we paid, we thought we were going to get a lot less...solo pleasantly surprised. We have friends who paid at least three times more than we did and didn't have the one on one attention that we did. Chris was amazing, always reminding my husband and I t have a seat and eat some food and always with a drink for us before we even expected it. Kristen made sure all went well throughout the entire planning and partying...especially since we live 2 hours away. I never felt I had to follow up or ask twice for anything. She was awesome. Totally renewing our vows there!!! Our friends always ask when we are going back because they loves it! Final thought: it totally rained and ruined our outdoor wedding but Kristen and crew moved it all indoors and made it so nice I wouldn't have it any other way today.</p>\n<p><strong>-Ana</strong></p>"}
