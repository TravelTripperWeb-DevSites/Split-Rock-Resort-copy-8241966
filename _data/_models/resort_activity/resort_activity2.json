Hoping to draw him out of the shadows, CIA director Robert Dewey assigns hacker and counterinsurgency expert Heather Lee to find him. Lee suspects that former operative Nicky Parsons is also looking for him. As she begins tracking the duo, Bourne finds himself back in action battling a sinister network that utilizes terror and technology to maintain unchecked power.<br /><br /><strong>Coming Soon <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9.16.16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9.23.16</strong><br /><img src=\"../../assets/images/Movie%20-Tarzan.jpg?sha=888db3ba8e1ab60b7cb7d7f65b11173ae025ce84\" width=\"43\" height=\"82\" /> <img src=\"../../assets/images/Movie_Lights_out.jpg?sha=2ea2d280e90748ca0836d4e9f95a5fa8a0cbb530\" width=\"55\" height=\"82\" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"../../assets/images/Movie%20-%20Stork.jpg?sha=93b831ce09b26cf1ca8d6f81a61a5c7f63a0a7bc\" width=\"54\" height=\"79\" /></p>\n<div style=\"width: 100%; float: left;\">&nbsp;</div>","price":"<p>Matin&eacute;e: $6.50 Adult | $5.00 Child<br /> Evening: $9.50 Adult | $7.00 Child</p>","order":2}
