During their walk outside, they encounter a group of ferocious alley cats and wind up in a truck that's bound for the pound. Luckily, a rebellious rabbit named Snowball swoops in to save the doggy duo from captivity. In exchange, Snowball demands that Max and Duke join his gang of abandoned pets on a mission against the humans who've done them wrong.</p>","price":"<p>Matin&eacute;e: $6.50 Adult | $5.00 Child<br /> Evening: $9.50 Adult | $7.00 Child</p>","order":2}
